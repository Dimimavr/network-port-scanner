Git is a distributed version control system designed to track changes in source code during software development. It allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously without conflicts, making it easier to manage large projects, collaborate on code, and maintain version history.

Key Features of Git:
Version Tracking: Git records changes to files over time, allowing developers to revert to previous states and understand project history.
Branching and Merging: Developers can create branches to work on new features or fixes independently, then merge them back into the main codebase when ready.
Collaboration: Git facilitates collaboration by allowing multiple developers to work on different parts of a project simultaneously, minimizing code conflicts.
Distributed: Every developer has a full copy of the repository, ensuring data redundancy and providing the ability to work offline.
Typical Git Commands:
git init: Initializes a new Git repository.
git clone: Creates a local copy of an existing repository.
git add: Stages changes for the next commit.
git commit: Saves changes to the repository with a message.
git push: Uploads local changes to a remote repository (e.g., GitHub).
git pull: Fetches and integrates changes from a remote repository.
